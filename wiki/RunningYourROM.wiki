= Running your GBA ROM in !VisualBoy Advance =

After you've created a ROM file from your project, you can now run your ROM in !VisualBoy Advance.

----

First, let's find your project.

Use the "Run" command (as described in the [BuildingAROMFile] tutorial), and enter the path to your project:

{{{
   c:\gamedev\projects\mygame
}}}

Note the “c:” at the beginning of the line.

This will open up a window that shows the files in your project directory.

Since you just built your project in the previous tutorial, your project directory should look like the one shown here.

Find the `mygame.gba` file icon and double-click it.

The very first time you double-click on the .gba file, Windows will complain that it does not know how to open a file of that type.

Choose "Select the program from a list" and press "OK".

You'll be shown a long list of applications to choose from.

Unfortunately, !VisualBoyAdvance is not listed there, so you'll need to press the "Browse..." button and find it.

The !VisualBoyAdvance.exe file is located in the:

{{{
   c:\gamedev\VisualBoyAdvance-1.7.2
}}}

directory.

After you select !VisualBoyAdvance, press "OK" on the "Open With" dialog.

!VisualBoyAdvance will run and launch the ROM file that you created.

You can use the arrow keys on your computer to move the sprite around the screen.

The next time you double-click on a .gba file, you won't have to go through the steps of selecting an application — !VisualBoyAdvance will launch directly.
