== 0.7.1 ==

  * Merge VerticalFlipObject and HorizontalFlipObject into FlipObject
  * Merge ShowObject and HideObject into ShowObject
  * Automatically generate Programmer's Notepad project (pnproj) file when exporting
  * Add Rotate (90 clockwise, 90 counterclockwise, 180)
  * Add Flip (horizontal, vertical, both)
  * Add File::Recent Files menu
  * Fix bug where sprites didn't get moved into correct spritelist group when resized larger
  * Fix bug where undoing a sprite resize (or rotate) would render the sprite in the old group in the spritelist.

== 0.6.8 ==

  * Change InitObject() to no longer require starting x,y coords. Add MoveObjectTo() after InitObject() in generated code. This allows us to call GetObjectWidth(), et al, when calculating the initial position of the object.
  * Add option in Export dialog to update the project. This updates all project files except for game_state.(cpp|h) and makes it easier for previously generated projects to be updated to the latest project code (without overwriting the project-specific code in game_state.(cpp|h).
  * Update About dialog to include reference to http://code.google.com/p/spritely location.
