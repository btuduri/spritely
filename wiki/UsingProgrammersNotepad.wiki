#summary Using Programmer's Notepad

= Using Programmer's Notepad =

"Programmer's Notepad" is a text editor that is packaged with the devkitPro installer. We will use it to view and edit the source code to our GBA game.

While "Programmer's Notepad" is convenient because it is already installed for as part of the devkitPro installation, you should feel free to use whatever text editor you prefer.

----

First, find the "Programmer's Notepad" application.

It's located in:

{{{
   c:\devkitpro\Programmers Notepad
}}}

Find the `pn.exe` icon and double-click it.

When "Programmer's Notepad" first opens, it will look something like this.

Note the "<new>" window in the middle and the extra windows along the left, right and bottom of the workspace.

Let's clean up the workspace a bit by closing all of these extra windows.

Close all of the sub-windows by clicking on their close box. Each close box has been marked with a circle in the following image.

Be careful not to click the close box for "Programmer's Notepad" or else you'll have to launch the application all over again.

Ahh... That looks better.

Now we're going to create a "project" for our project.

Under the "File" menu, select "New" and then select "Project".

This will pull up the "New Project..." dialog.

Enter the name of your project (`mygame`) into the "Name:" field.

For the "Folder:", press the "..." button at the far right. This will bring up a dialog that allows you to select the project location.

Select your `c:\gamedev\projects\mygame` folder and press "OK".

When you get back to the "New Project..." dialog, double-check to make sure that the information is correct and then press "OK".

This creates a project window pane on the left side of the "Programmer's Notepad" workspace.

However, the newly created project is empty â€” we now need to add our files to it.

We can add our files to the project by right-clicking on the project name (`mygame`) and selecting "Add Files".

http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_10.png

In the "Add Files" dialog, navigate to the `c:\gamedev\projects\mygame\source` directory.

http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_11.png

Select all of the files in this directory and press "Open".

You will now see a whole bunch of source files in your project.

[http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_12.png http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/sm/pn_12.png]

These are the files that are used to build your GBA project. You'll be editing these files in later tutorials.

To open a source file, just double-click on the icon next to the filename.

[http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_13.png http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/sm/pn_13.png]

To make the window so that it fills the entire workspace, press the "Maximize" button in the upper-right corner of the window.

http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_13b.png

This will allow you to see more of the file at a time (which makes it easier to make changes to the code).

One nice feature of "Programmer's Notepad" is that you can build and run your GBA project easily without switching to another application.

To build your project, select "make" from the "Tools" menu.

http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_15.png

This will open up an "Output" window at the bottom of the workspace and automatically enter the make command for you.

[http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/pn_16.png http://spritely.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/pn/sm/pn_16.png]

The output of the `make` command will be displayed in this output window.

If you see

{{{
   ROM fixed!
}}}

or

{{{
   ... is up to date.
}}}

at the end of the ouput, then your project was built successfully.

To run your program after it's built, select "run" from the "Tools" menu.

If you've already made the file association (as shown in [RunningYourROM] tutorial), then this will automatically launch !VisualBoy Advance with your ROM.
