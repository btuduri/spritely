Change InitObject() to no longer require starting x,y coords
  Add MoveObjectTo() after InitObject() in generated code.
  This allows us to call GetObjectWidth(), et al, when calculating the initial
  position of the object.
Add option in Export dialog to update the project. This updates all project
  files except for game_state.(cpp|h) and makes it easier for previously
  generated projects to be updated to the latest project code (without overwriting
  the project-specific code in game_state.(cpp|h).
Update About dialog to include reference to code.google.com/p/spritely location.
